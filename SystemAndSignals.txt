What is a System?
    => System is group of components and its functionaliy. 

System Structure:   G =   (C,L) where C is components and L is Connection. 
Components = {C0, C1 ..... CN}
Connectionn = {L1, L2, .... LN}

What does a function means actually?
    For example we want to build a calculator. What are the steps?
First we have to find out which function should our calculator should posses. such as addition , substraction,
multiply and division. And also we have to figure out how many parameters it can take total. 
For now just say we want to make one basic calculator that can perform these operations using two inputs. 

Then we have define the function. Like as follows: 
    f(Sum) = a + b
    f(mult) = a * b
    f(div) = a / b
    f(sub) = a - b

So from the function only we can see that. There is different components we need to take care of. 
such as input and operators.

Any system we desing consists Structure and behaviour. Structure means , how is the system built and behaviour
means for what function we built that system. There is input and output which helps us to determine the design of 
the system. 

It includes following steps: 
    Analysis: 
        Determine the behaviour of the given system. How is that system should be built actually. 

    Synthesis: 
        Design a system that determine or gives the output on the basis of our Analysis.

Lets go ahead. 
    Now we are at  code and codewords. 
    Lets talk about binay codes. 
        given is the binary code upto 6. 
            0 = 000
            1 = 001
            2 = 010
            3 = 011
            4 = 100
            5 = 101
            6 = 110

Relation between codes:
    The number of symbols: n
    Number of binary decisions: m

    n < 2 to the power m 
    m = (log2n) round down

    Number of possible code: k = M! /(M-n) !

Presentation of whole numbers in binary. 
We have following four methods. 

1) Offset Presentation: 
        In this we have offset which we use to represent positive and negative numbers. 
    Just say we want to represent to whole number using 4 bit. Lets see how many numbers can fit. 
    So we have four bits that means we can represent 2 to the power 4 means = 16 numbers altogether. 
    But how will we start ? 0000 represent 0. but to represent all the number we will divide 16 by 2 it means 8
    so from 0 to 15 we will substract 8. And our table of whole number will be ready. 
    lets do it. 

    We have four digits. that means = we have to substract by 8
    0000 = 0 = 0-8 = -8
    0001 = 1 = 1-8 = -7
    0010 = 2 = 2-8 = -6
    0011 = 3 = 3-8 = -5
    0100 = 4 = 4-8 = -4
    0101 = 5 = 5-8 = -3 
    0110 = 6 = 6-8 = -2
    ...................
    ...................
    ...................
    1111 = 15 = 15-8 = 7
This is how we can represent numbers using this offset Presentation. 

2)Signed Bit 
    In this we use 0 to represent + sign  and 1 to represent - sign. 
    But here also we have some issues. 
    Lets make a table. 
    000
    001
    010
    011
    100
    101
    110
    111
